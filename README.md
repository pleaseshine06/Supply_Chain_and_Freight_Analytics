## Problem Statement

  1) Lack of visibility into logistics and freight costs affecting cost control.
  2) Variability in profitability between product categories and regions.
  3) Identification of seasonal trends and customer behavior patterns impacting sales and expenses.

## Tools & Technologies used

  1) Microsoft Excel (advanced formulas, PivotTables, charts, Power Query)
  2) Data cleaning and preprocessing within Excel
  3) Interactive dashboards leveraging Excel slicers and visualization tools

## Scope of Analysis
